# PetroBuffer
A python package for performing geochemical redox calculations and buffer conversions.

The current implementation has been developed in Python 3 and tested on Windows.

``PetroBuffer`` currently only supports a small number of functions. The aim is to expand this package over time.

## Installation/Usage:

As this package has yet to be published on PyPI, it CANNOT be installed using pip.

For now, the suggested method is to put the folder `petrobuffer` and it's contents in the same directory as your source files and call ``import petrobuffer``.

## Acknowledgements

The testing of this package made heavy use of the excellent Excel tools from Kayla Iacovino: an [fO2 buffer calculator](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5907867)  and a [Ferric/Ferrous converter](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5907844).
